# Discord Reddit Helper
---

This is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot for helping with common [Reddit](https://reddit.com) tasks. Well... perhaps not tasks, at least not yet.

## Current Functions
---
This bot can currently only do two things, with one more on the way!

It can convert "r/" style shortlinks put in Discord chat to full Reddit links.  
It can also generate a sentence based on what a Redditor says and some markov chain based magic.

It will soon be able to generate a sentence based on what a subreddit says, but I'm still working on the logic for that one.
